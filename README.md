# OBS-Kill-counter

1. Download Autohotkey from www.autohotkey.com - and install it
2. Download this repo as a zip and extract where you want (I recommend the desktop)
3. Right click on AHK_Script and hit edit, then change "filePath" to match your file path.
OPTIONAL - Change the buttons inside AHK_Script to your liking - I've included a file for the button names. To do this, change XButton1 or F11 (keep the two colons!)
4. Save the script and run it (you can double click it)
5. Open OBS, add a text source, select from file, and choose the kill_counter.txt file
6. Press the button you set to increase the value to test it (THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU'RE INSIDE THE OBS WINDOW. PUT OBS ON YOUR SECOND MONITOR, AND GO TO YOUR OTHER MONITOR AND TEST)

95% of credit goes to: https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/guide-death-counter.3345/ - All I did was edit a few things like reset value and easier setup
